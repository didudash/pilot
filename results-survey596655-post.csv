In the second half of the game, if coins were kept by the player, NICO would automatically select just one coin to entrust the player. It would be NICO's main idea to keep the coin he would receive as to maximise its gain. It the player would return the coins, it would update its knowledge on the player and decide to resume returning coins to the player. This procedure would continue if both parties would return the coins entrusted to them. NICO increases the amount of coins entrusted as the player keeps on returning them. I suppose that NICO would keep the coins if the player entrusted 10 (or maybe 9) coins, but I could not get the opportunity to test this hypothesis.","Yes","If the number of coins NICO entrusted me were smaller than that I entrusted it, I would automatically return them as a means to gain NICO's trust. This would lead NICO to increase the number of coins entrusted and it would make it return the coins I entrust to it. By the time the quantity entrusted was high enough, e.g., 7 or 8, I decided to keep the coins to myself.","3","Beating my opponent","","Yes","3","1","2","7","6","9","2","9","1","2","4","1","5","4","4","4","Based on the experiment itself, and especially on the questions of the post-questionnaire, I think the experiment was about the relation of trust in the interaction of humans and robots, and how humans could perceive humanoid robots as trustful.",""

If I kept his coins then he would entrust only 1 coin the next time and otherwise entrust a random number of coins between 3 and 6. (seems it was a genuine coincidence that I entrusted 8 coins exactly on the 8th round - that put me on the wrong trail it seems)","Yes","I started cautiously, but once I noticed that the NICO keeps >=8 coins I would entrust 7 and then 1-3 on the next go (just in case NICO's strategy was to start keeping coins <=7 if I keep it too often) so that I can return my coins without losing many, and entrust 7 again on the next round. Using this strategy I kept NICOs coins low and mine high (even though the task was specifically to maximise your own coins, and NOT to maximise the difference in coins to your opponent). Eventually I risked entrusting 7 coins on consecutive rounds when I inferred that NICO never keeps <=7 coins, even if you've kept them often.","2","Maximising my earnings","Correctly figuring out NICOs strategy","Yes","3","1","4","7","8","8","2","5","3","2","2","4","4","2","3","2","Gauging the effects of NICOs utterances and facial expressions on the participant's gameplay and willingness to trust the NICO with many coins on subsequent rounds, i.e. see if the robot could have emotional influence on the participant.","I think the experimental setup was really well done aesthetically.
